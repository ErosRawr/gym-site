1. OVERALL DESIGN GOALS

This is a commercial gym website, not a coach or influencer page.

Visual tone: clean, confident, premium, welcoming

No gimmicks, no cheesy animations, no over-stimulation

Inspired by Smart Fit completeness, not Planet Fitness branding

Must feel trustworthy, scalable, and “real”

Emotional goals

Confidence → “This gym knows what it’s doing”

Accessibility → “Anyone can train here”

Energy → “This place is active, modern, alive”

2. COLOR SYSTEM (STRICT)
Palette (DO NOT DEVIATE)

Primary: Off-white (warm, not gray)

Example: #f5f5f2

Secondary: Near-black (not pure black)

Example: #0f0f12

Accent: Deep dark red (clean, not dull, not burgundy)

Example: #8b1e1e or #7a1818

Usage rules

Off-white = background, breathing space, readability

Black = headers, nav, footer, structure

Dark red = CTAs only, highlights, active states

Never use accent red for long text

Never use more than one accent color

3. TYPOGRAPHY RULES
Fonts

Use one modern sans-serif family

Prefer:

Inter

Segoe UI

Manrope

Use weight variation, not font changes

Hierarchy

H1: Strong, short, confident

H2: Section anchors

H3: Feature titles

Body text: Clean, slightly muted

Copy tone

Short sentences

No motivational clichés

No “transform your life” fluff

Speak like a facility, not a coach
